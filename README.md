# WebFinal2016

Guidelines:
1) defining the minimum viable services required for this application, and documenting the service endpoints and description like our assignments.
2) implement a node.js module that is responsible for requesting from `On the snow` services.
3) build a very simple client side web app that roughly visualized the user interaction with this app.
4) implement an express application that provides API endpoint for web clients all the services/endpoints you need.
5) verify the successful communication between client web app and your express app.
6) call the services provided by the node.js module you developed in step 2/, as users ask for them form client app.
7) make the client app look nice and UX/UI pleasant.
